No Name Change is a simple uMod/Oxide plugin for the popular Facepunch video game Rust. The purpose of the plugin is to prevent players from changing their steam username after they have logged into the server the mod is installed on.  WHen a user first logs into the Rust server the pluggin is installed on, the pluggin will capture the username and steam64id (steams unique ID for users) and store it in a local data file.  Everytime a user tries to establsish a connection to the server, No Name Change will look in the data file for the steam64id.  If it does not exist it records the user logging in for the first time.  If it finds the user, it will compare the username it recorded to the one currently being used by the user.  If they match the user is connected to the game.  If they do not match, the connection is rejected and the message "Username changes mid wipe are not allowed.".  When you wipe your server simply clear the NoNameChanges.json file from the oxide data directory, and start the process all over again.
